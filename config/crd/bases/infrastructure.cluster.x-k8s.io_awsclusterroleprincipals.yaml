This is a standard Kubernetes LabelSelector, a label query over a set of resources. The result of matchLabels and matchExpressions are ANDed. Controllers must not support AWSClusters in namespaces outside this selector. \n An empty selector (default) indicates that AWSClusters can use this AWSClusterPrincipal from any namespace. This field is intentionally not a pointer because the nil behavior (no namespaces) is undesirable here."

                description: A unique identifier that might be required when you assume a role in another account. If the administrator of the account to which the role belongs provided you with an external ID, then provide that value in the ExternalId parameter. This value can be any string, such as a passphrase or account number. A cross-account role is usually set up to trust everyone in an account. Therefore, the administrator of the trusting account might send an external ID to the administrator of the trusted account. That way, only someone with the ID can assume the role, rather than everyone in the account. For more information about the external ID, see How to Use an External ID When Granting Access to Your AWS Resources to a Third Party in the IAM User Guide.

For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of referencing a part of an object. TODO: this design is not final and this field is subject to change in the future.'
